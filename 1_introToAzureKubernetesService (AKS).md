# Introduction to Azure
Azure is a cloud computing platform that offers:

- Infrastructure as a service (IAS)
- Platform as a service (PAS)
- Software as a service (SAS)

## Azure management levels

1. Tenant
*...manages multiple...*
2. Management groups
*...manages multiple...*
3. Subscriptions (billing occurs here)
*...manages multiple...*
4. Resource groups
*...manages multiple...*
5. Resources (*called Azure services*)
	-  Can be grouped into resource clusters (*collection of resources within a resource group*)

## Key concepts

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Load balancing + proxy + reverse proxy
	- Ingress (intermediate for managing the above)
- Multi-tenant services
- Azure development and deployment
	- Azure container registry
	- Azure build & release pipeline
	- Azure container instances & virtual nodes (*wherein only the required containers (containing services or functions) are provided, with their operation (ex. the virtual machine, development environment, etc.) being abstracted (i.e. managed by Azure) for the end-user*)
- Autoscaling

## Azure CLI and Terraform
Azure CLI (Command Line Interface) is a CLI provided by Azure to manage resource groups and creating, managing and provisioning clusters.

Terraform is the high-level scripting language that is portable, i.e. can be used to access the APIs, services, templates, etc. from any cloud computing platform. It can perform the same functions as Azure CLI, but can be applied for other cloud computing platforms (as well as multiple platforms together) also.
