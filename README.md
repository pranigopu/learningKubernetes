# Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. The name "Kubernetes" originates from Greek, meaning 'helmsman' or 'pilot'.

## Approach
We shall be using Azure as the cloud computing platform to develop and deploy applications, and we shall then use Kubernetes to orchestrate these applications. To do this, we shall use AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), which offers the quickest way to start developing and deploying cloud-native apps (i.e. apps residing in the cloud) in Azure with built-in code-to-cloud pipelines and guardrails. As a Kubernetes service hosted on the Azure platform, AKS handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance, and is highly available, secure and fully managed.
